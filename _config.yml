# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

    We adopted that name for our outpost because it is a beacon of talent—a counterculture to what many think of technology at the Defense,
    Our mission is to figure out how to work better inside of the world’s largest bureaucracy while fixing the problems of hardware and software — 
    quickly — to support the mission. Everyone sees themselves as a nerd, and we’re trying to empower the nerds inside of an organization that 
    maybe doesn’t value or handle technical talent correctly.
