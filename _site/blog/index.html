        </h2>

	<p>For our internal CTF for tryouts the past two years, I have had a series of challenges called <em>Stevie and Ray</em>.</p>

<p>These challenges were favorites with the cadets. Both challenges were released in the Fall 2016 challenge with many
solves for the first part, but none for the second. For Fall 2017, I re-released Stevie and Ray 2 and it had 3 or 4 solves
this semester. In this post, I will reveal the details of how Stevie and Ray are created, and how they can be solved.</p>

	<p>In my <a href="/teaching/cy-350-networking-engineering-and-design">IT350</a> course, I like to add some capture the flag events on the final project as bonus questions. I take this opportunity to expose the students to CTF games and also allow them to go deeper on a subject that has been covered in class.</p>

<p>This semester I had a three part problem with three flags. The first two flags were worth three points each and the last one was for four points. The flags were to be solved in order and the difficult increased with each one. Below is the problem statement given in the assignment:</p>

	<p><em>This article previously appeared <a href="http://www.pointerview.com/2017/02/02/eecs-cadets-faculty-enter-live-codewarz-for-first-time/">here.</a></em></p>

<p>Codewarz is a programming competition designed by and for active duty cyber Soldiers to sharpen computer programming and coding skills of Soldiers in a world with constant cyber challenges. Codewarz is hosted by the Cyber Protection Brigade at Fort Gordon, Georgia and it hosts a series of programming competitions throughout the year.</p>

<p>The competitions have two components, live and online competitions. The live competition was held for the first time at the U.S. Military Academy Jan. 21.</p>

<p>“The event features programming challenges that include a wide range of topics from traditional computer science type problems to more applied cyber-related problems,” Maj. Benjamin Klimkowski, assistant professor in the Electoral Engineering and Computer Science Department, said.</p>

	<p>The great folks at SANS and CounterHack have brought us another adventure in the land of Josh and Jessica Dosis. This years challenge is called Santa’s Business Card. The game can be found <a href="http://holidayhackchallenge.com">here</a>. After saving the world from the nefarious plot of the ATNA Corporation last year, siblings Josh and Jessica find themselves in a pickle when Santa gets kidnapped from there house on Christmas Eve. All that is left is Santa’s business card. Its up to us to help the Dosis kids save Christmas (again…).</p>

<p>Four members of the Cadet Competitive Cyber Team (C3T) spent 36 straight hours over Veterans Day Weekend hacking into New York University, Tandon School of Engineering computers. These actions were fully endorsed by NYU and part of the Cyber Security Awareness Week (CSAW) North American Capture the Flag (CTF) Championship.</p>

<p>This annual event features teams from the top computer science schools in the nation. West Point’s team advanced to the championship round for the sixth straight year, and finished in ninth place—the highest finish ever for the team known in hacking competitions as BitsForEveryone (BFE).</p>

	<p class="center"><img src="/assets/images/ekoctf2016/punchcard.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As part of BitsForEveryone, I competed in <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/342">EKO Party CTF 2016</a>. This CTF had a great Misc 250 point challenged called “Old But Gold.”</p>

<p>My students immediately pointed this challenge out to me since they knew I loved punch cards. A few months prior, I had written a challenge for our internal try-out CTF in which they were given a base64 encoced ascii art image of an IBM-29 punch card with a message encoded for them. It was a favorite for the students. It took me about 20 minutes to repurpose my code to solve this challenge.</p>
