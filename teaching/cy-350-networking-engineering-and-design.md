**Description** (from catalog): 

_This course addresses the analysis, design, building, and testing of modern computer networks. Network implementation techniques and considerations are discussed and practiced extensively. Key concepts include analysis and design using standardized network models, protocols and practices such as the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) network model, subnetting, static/dynamic routing, switching, and access control. Practical skills implementing network designs are also reinforced through a number of hands-on laboratory exercises using commodity network hardware._
