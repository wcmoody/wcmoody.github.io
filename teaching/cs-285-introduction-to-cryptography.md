Science by introducing the topic of cryptography. Securing modern digital communications
requires the use of strong ciphers to guarantee confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
Understanding the history of cryptography, the foundational mathematical principles, and current
implementation of cryptography will allow students to advance in the topic of computer science
and cybersecurity. Each student is expected to keep up with the assigned reading, view recorded
lectures, and complete homework assignments. Additional students are expected to seek out help
from the instructor when encountering roadblocks in learning.
