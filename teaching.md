I taught classes at USMA from 2015-2019. During that time, I taught courses in both of the majors in the computing programs in the EECS department. My main courses were the networking engineering course (IT350) and operating systems (CS481). I got to cut my teeth by teaching our freshman (called Plebes) introductory programming and information technology (IT105). I advised a student on an independent research project and I used an independent study to prepare cadets to compete as a team in the inaugural [NSA Cyber Exercise](https://www.nsa.gov/What-We-Do/Cybersecurity/NCX/)
Additionally I have served as an Adjunct Professor at University of South Carolina - Aiken teaching introduction to Cryptography.
